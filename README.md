# 📱 My Android Apps (Throwback Collection)

Hey there!  
This repo is a collection of some of the Android apps I made back in my early dev days — mostly during college times when I was just getting into mobile development. These apps are basic, but they bring back tons of good memories of experimenting, debugging, and learning Android Studio one crash at a time 😅.

## 🛠️ What’s Inside?

Some of the cool (and sometimes silly) apps I built

> Most of these apps were made using **Java** with **XML layouts**, and the good old **Android Studio**.

## 🤓 Why This Repo Exists

Honestly? Just vibes.  
I didn’t want to lose these projects because they remind me how far I’ve come. From making these small apps to now working on full-stack platforms and machine learning models — it’s been a journey! 🚀

## 🏁 How to Run

If you feel like running them:

1. Open Android Studio.
2. Clone the project or copy-paste individual folders.
3. Build and run on emulator or physical device.

(But fair warning: Some projects might need SDK version updates.)

## 📸 Screenshots?

Sadly, I lost most of the screenshots when I changed laptops. But the UIs were super basic — think buttons, edit texts, toasts, and scroll views. Classic Android starter stuff.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Layout design (Linear, Relative, Constraint)
- Activity lifecycle
- Intents and data passing
- Working with timers and inputs
- Handling user data (shared preferences & files)
- Debugging crashes like a champ 😅

That’s all!  
If you randomly found this repo — enjoy the trip down memory lane. And if you’re just starting Android dev, trust me, it gets better and better from here ❤️
